# RPSLS
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

This web app was created as an introductory to Node.js. The purpose of this app is to allow a user to play RPSLS against another human, or against a computer. The game is played similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors, but with a twist. This game is commonly known for being played in the Big Bang Theory, and this is my attempt to recreate it while learning a new programming language.
