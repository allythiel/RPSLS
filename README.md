# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. 

This is an app that was created to allow a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock within the terminal on their computers. In this application you will find the following technologies:
- Node.js

The purpose of this app is to allow a user or multiple users to play RPSLS on their computer. As a user, you have the ability to select playing against another human or against a computer, as there are two different player modes built in. This game is played similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors, but has an added twist of two other options, Lizard and Spock! This game is commonly known for being played in the Big Bang Theory by Sheldon, and this is my attempt to recreate it while also learning a new programming language.
